                                                GENERAL INFORMATION
  **SortAlgorithms** is my own research project aimed to compare performance of different type of sorting algorithms.
  
Tested performance parameters are: 
- **TIME** (nanoseconds) 
- **SWAPS** (number of swaps) 
- **COMPARISONS** (number of comparisons)

  There are four types of arrays in project: 
- **ASC** (already sorted array)
- **DESC** (sorted descending)
- **RANDOM** (array with random elements)
- **DUPLICATED** (array with a lot of duplications)

  All types of arrays contain only integer elements. Arrays of all types are generated once and all algorithms perform on the same array as input.
